    "# Analysing Employee Exit Surveys of 2 Australian Educational Institutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). <br> <br>\n",
    "In this project, we'll try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",

However this last observation may be correlated by the years of service factor as well, as employees with long experience at the institutes are usually older."

    "We can conlude from our analyis that employees who stayed longer in the institutes are more likely to leave for a dissatisfaction reason. <br> Dissatisfaction seems not to be really correlated with the age of resignees. Although elder employees are more likely to leave due to dissatisfaction, this may be understood because of their long experience within the institute, not their age.<br> <br>\n",
    "Our anlaysis is consistent with a [study conducted by SMS Research Advisors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171108006002/en/Age-Number-Engage-Employees-Career-Stage), which makes the argument that understanding employee's needs according to career stage instead of age is more effective."
