# Analysing-Employee-Exit-Surveys-of-2-Australian-Educational-Institutes

In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

In this project, we'll try to answer the following questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
